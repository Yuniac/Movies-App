# Movies-App
The website is an attempt to duplicate this [design](https://dribbble.com/shots/15830585-IMDb-Redesign-2021), IMDB reimagined.
I took the liberty to edit the design to make it fit my abilities in terms of features and whatnot.

The API in use is the API of [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Table Of Content:
* What can the website do Currently.
* Features I'm looking forward to adding to it in the future.



## -What can the website do Currently:

You can browse movies, TV shows and search for both, using a keyword or search by year of release. You can also search for actors and celebrities and view some basic information about them. Also, movies are susceptible to be filtered for most popular, upcoming and new, high rated, low rated. All according to the API.


## -Features I'm looking forward to adding to it in the future:
* Let users log in/out and store favorite movies/TV shows and store a watch later kind of list.
* and whatever new ideas come to my mind.

## App usage.

To use the app you need to clone the repo locally then run `parcel index.html` (you need to have [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) installed).
